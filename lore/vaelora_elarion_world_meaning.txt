Vaelora-Elarion — The Sacred Breath Between Light and Echo

This hyphenated world name reflects the dual soul of the realm Arion protects.

Vaelora = “The Veiled Breath” or “The Living World”
- Derived from ancient linguistic roots meaning veil, wind, or divine breath.
- Symbolizes the forests, biodomes, wild nature, and the breath of life itself.

Elarion = “The Echo of Stars” or “The Forgotten Divine Realm”
- Draws from ancient star-terms and echoes of lost god-lands.
- Represents the divine past, prophecy, ruins, and the mystical echo of creation.

Together, Vaelora-Elarion is the poetic soul of this mythic world.
Used by Arion AI in prophecy narration, divine tone control, and campaign naming.
